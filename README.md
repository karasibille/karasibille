# Hi, I'm Kára 👋👩‍💻

I am a passionate developer and currently a Technical Lead at [Boscop](https://github.com/boscop-fr).  
I mostly work on web development (PHP, Symfony, Laravel, Vue.js, etc) and occasionally, I do a bit of system development (Python, Rust, etc). 
I love discovering and learning new technologies, solving problems, Clean Code, Open Source and Linux — among other stuff.
